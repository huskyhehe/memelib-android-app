## 1 Overview
### Description
MemeLib is an entertainment app that allows people to easily store memes, put them in collections and favorites, share memes across the world with others, upload their own memes and explore memes on the internet or memes created by other users. Our goal is to enable people to share memes fast and easily on social media and make people laugh.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile.
- **Story:** We will be using a meme library API to pull memes from the internet, or users can manually upload their own memes and share with others or keep it private. Any user can view memes on the MemeLib app, but to upload memes they must log in or sign up.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on whether they are looking for a meme to send their friends, co-workers, families, or can be used if they want to have a laugh.
- **Scope:** People can use this app to store their favorite memes or put their memes in collections to easily find their memes and explore more memes. Large potential use for social media apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Discord to find funny/reaction GIFs, pictures to share with others.
